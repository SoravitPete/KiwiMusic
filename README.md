KiwiMusic is a wiki web application for music. We have information of various songs. KiwiMusic 
is made for people who’re interested in music. You’ll know more songs and exchange ideas 
with other people who love music as well.

## Background

When we are interested in any song, we often have to search for information about it in several steps. 
So we need a resource that combines information about that song fully in one place. And often when we 
listen to a song and feel hyped, we often want to exchange opinions with people who like this song 
like us. So there is a music thread feature to exchange musical ideas. There is always something new
about music to exchange ideas because in the world of music new things are happening all the time.
